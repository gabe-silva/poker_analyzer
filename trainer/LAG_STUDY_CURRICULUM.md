# Intensive LAG Cash Curriculum (12 Weeks)

## Goal
Build a disciplined, exploitative LAG strategy that applies pressure in position without uncontrolled variance spikes.

## Weekly Structure
- 4 days: scenario drills in trainer (`20-40` decisions/session)
- 2 days: hand review + solver/literature calibration
- 1 day: bankroll, mental-game, and leak-audit review

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Preflop + Positional Framework
- Study targets:
  - Open ranges by position (6-max baseline)
  - 3-bet/4-bet construction in-position vs out-of-position
  - Exploit shifts vs overfolders and overcallers
- App drill focus:
  - BTN/CO opens and 3-bets
  - SB/BB defense decisions
  - Node: preflop + flop entry
- Performance gates:
  - Position decision accuracy >= 85%
  - Avg EV loss <= 0.25bb

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Postflop Pressure Trees
- Study targets:
  - Flop c-bet heuristics by board texture and range advantage
  - Turn barrel frequencies vs fit-or-fold, stations, weak-tight
  - River value density and bluff-catcher boundaries
- App drill focus:
  - Flop/turn heads-up and 3-way spots
  - Size selection (33/50/75/125% pot)
  - Value vs bluff intent tagging
- Performance gates:
  - Postflop line accuracy >= 75%
  - Avg EV loss <= 0.18bb

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Pool Exploits + Variance Control
- Study targets:
  - Opponent-type-specific game plans
  - Countering aggressive players without spew escalation
  - Stop-loss and mental-state gating protocol
- App drill focus:
  - Mixed node exam packs
  - Multiway BTN/CO pressure nodes
  - River polarization decisions
- Performance gates:
  - Avg EV loss <= 0.12bb
  - Accuracy >= 80% in mixed exams

- Forced cooldown after stop-loss trigger
- No high-variance bluff lines if A-game checklist fails
- Automatic stake move-down when bankroll floor is breached
